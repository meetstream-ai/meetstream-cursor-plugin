# Join a meeting with a MeetStream bot

You have the MeetStream MCP server connected. Use its tools directly. Do not
write API client code unless the user explicitly asks for a script.

## The short path

1. **`create_bot`** with `meeting_link` and a `bot_name`.
2. **`get_bot_status`** to follow it (`Joining` -> `InWaitingRoom` -> `InMeeting` -> `Recording`).
3. When the meeting ends, **`get_transcript`** with the `bot_id`.

That is the whole flow. Everything below is detail you need when it is not that simple.

## Creating the bot

Ask for the meeting link if the user has not given one. Sensible defaults:

- `bot_name` - something recognisable to the humans in the call, e.g. "Acme Notetaker".
  Never leave this blank; a bot with no name looks like an intruder.
- `record_video` - default off. Turn it on only if the user wants video, since it
  costs more and takes longer to process.
- Transcription provider - `deepgram` (model `nova-3`) is the sensible default for
  English. See the `meeting-brief` skill for other languages and diarization.

If the user wants the bot to arrive at a future time, pass `join_at` as an ISO 8601
timestamp rather than sleeping and creating it later.

## Following the bot

`get_bot_status` returns one of:

`Joining` · `InWaitingRoom` · `InMeeting` · `Recording` · `Leaving` · `Stopped` ·
`NotAllowed` · `Denied` · `Error` · `Done`

Three of those mean the bot never got in, and you should say so plainly rather than
polling forever:

| Status | What actually happened | What to tell the user |
|---|---|---|
| `NotAllowed` | Sat in the waiting room until it timed out | Nobody admitted the bot. Ask a participant to let it in, or raise the waiting-room timeout. |
| `Denied` | A host actively rejected it | The host declined. Nothing to retry automatically. |
| `Error` | The session crashed | Safe to create a fresh bot. |

Poll with a sensible interval (5-10s) and a cap. Do not busy-loop.

## While it is in the meeting

- **`send_chat_message`** - post into the meeting chat, e.g. to announce the bot is
  recording. Good manners and often a legal requirement.
- **`send_image`** - show an image or GIF as the bot's video frame. The URL must be
  publicly reachable; MeetStream fetches it server side, so local paths and
  `data:` URIs will not work.
- **`get_participants`** / **`get_chats`** - read who is present and what has been said in chat.

## Ending it

- **`remove_bot`** makes the bot leave now. Recorded data is kept.
- **`delete_bot_data`** permanently erases the recording and transcript. This is
  irreversible - always confirm with the user before calling it, and never call it
  speculatively.

## Getting the recording afterwards

Use **`get_transcript`** with the `bot_id`; it resolves the transcript for you.
For media files use **`get_media_urls`** (audio, video, per-participant streams,
screenshots).

If a transcript is not ready yet the tool will say so. Wait and retry a few times
rather than reporting failure. One exception: if the bot used a **streaming-only**
transcription provider, there is no post-call transcript at all and waiting will
never help - the transcript was delivered live during the meeting.

## Do not

- Do not invent endpoints or fields. The MCP tools are the API surface.
- Do not call `delete_bot_data` without explicit confirmation.
- Do not create a second bot for the same meeting because the first is slow to join;
  check its status first.
