description: >
  Turn a finished MeetStream meeting into a brief: AI summary, action items,
  decisions, talk-time and who said what. Use when the user says "summarize
  that meeting", "what did we decide", "action items from the call", "brief me
  on this meeting", "who talked the most", "pull the transcript", "what did
  <person> say", or points at a bot_id and asks any question about the
  conversation. Also covers picking a transcription provider and language.

# Brief someone on a meeting

You have the MeetStream MCP server connected. Pull the real data with its tools
before writing anything. Never summarize a meeting you have not actually read.

## Fastest route to a brief

1. **`get_bot_summary`** - MeetStream's own AI summary. Try this first; it is one call.
2. **`get_transcript`** - the full transcript when you need detail, quotes, or your
   own analysis.
3. **`get_speaker_timeline`** - who spoke and for how long.
4. **`get_participants`** - the attendee list.

For a rich brief, combine 2-4. For "just tell me what happened", 1 is often enough.

## Reading the transcript correctly

Transcript segments carry a **`speaker`** and a **`transcript`** field. The text is in
`transcript`, not `text` - reading the wrong field is the single most common mistake
and produces an empty-looking brief.

Segments also carry `start_time` / `end_time`, which you need for timestamps and for
quoting "at 14:32 they said...".

If the transcript is not ready, the tool will tell you. Retry a few times with a gap.
If the bot used a **streaming-only** provider there will never be a post-call
transcript - say so instead of retrying forever.

## Talk-time and speaking balance

`get_speaker_timeline` returns chunks with byte offsets into the audio, not seconds.
Talk-time **shares** (percentages) are exact and safe to report. Absolute durations
require the sample rate to convert bytes to time - if you cannot establish it, report
shares and turn counts rather than inventing minute figures.

## What a good brief contains

Aim for something a person who missed the call can act on:

- **Outcome** - one or two sentences. What was actually settled.
- **Decisions** - each with who made it.
- **Action items** - owner and, where stated, a due date. Quote the line it came from.
- **Open questions** - things raised and not resolved.
- **Notable quotes** - only when the exact wording matters.
- **Participation** - talk-time shares, if relevant to the user's question.

Attribute claims to speakers. If something is ambiguous in the transcript, say it is
ambiguous rather than smoothing it over. A confidently wrong action item is worse
than a flagged uncertain one.

## Choosing a transcription provider (before the meeting)

Set this on `create_bot` via the transcription provider option:

| Need | Provider |
|---|---|
| English, general purpose | `deepgram` (model `nova-3`) |
| Speaker labels | `deepgram` with diarization enabled |
| Indic languages | `sarvam` |
| Alternative English engine | `assemblyai` |
| MeetStream's own engine | `meetstream` |
| Live captions during the call | any `*_streaming` provider |

Post-call providers give you a transcript to fetch afterwards. Streaming providers
deliver text live during the meeting and produce **no** post-call transcript. Pick
based on when the user needs the words, not on which sounds better.

## Re-running a transcription

If a transcription failed, was in the wrong language, or you want a second opinion
from another engine, use **`transcribe_audio`** on the existing bot. This works even
for bots that originally used a streaming-only provider, and is the only way to get a
post-call transcript for those.
